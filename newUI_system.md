# New UI system : UI elements and UI builder

Unity uses now UI elements to build in Editor
UI and UI in game (runtime).

For this purpose you have 2 files:
uxml : structure of your elements (closed to html and xml)
uxss : style of your elements (closed to css)

The code used for interaction is independant 
and work with the id of each element.

# Recipe (base on unty demo)
